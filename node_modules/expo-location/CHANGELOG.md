### üõ† Breaking changes

- Add `scope` field in returned value to indicate whether background permissions are granted. Add `android.accuracy` field to determine whether `coarse` or `fine` location permission is granted. ([#9446](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9446) by [@mczernek](https://github.com/mczernek))
- `getLastKnownPositionAsync` no longer rejects when the last known location is not available ‚Äì now it returns `null`. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Removed the deprecated `enableHighAccuracy` option of `getCurrentPositionAsync`. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Removed `maximumAge` and `timeout` options from `getCurrentPositionAsync` ‚Äì¬†it's been Android only and the same behavior can be achieved on all platforms on the JavaScript side. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Made type and enum names more consistent and in line with our standards ‚Äî they all are now prefixed by `Location`. The most common ones are still accessible without the prefix, but it's not the recommended way. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- `geocodeAsync` and `reverseGeocodeAsync` no longer falls back to Google Maps API on Android. ([#9444](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9444) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))

### üéâ New features

- Added missing `altitudeAccuracy` to the location object on Android (requires at least Android 8.0). ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Improved support for Web ‚Äî added missing methods for requesting permissions and getting last known position. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Added `maxAge` and `requiredAccuracy` options to `getLastKnownPositionAsync`. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Google Maps Geocoding API can now be used on all platforms with the new `useGoogleMaps` option. ([#9444](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9444) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Added `district`, `subregion` and `timezone` values to reverse-geocoded address object. ([#9444](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9444) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed different types being used on Web platform. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- `getLastKnownPositionAsync` no longer requests for the current location on iOS and just returns the last known one as it should be. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Fixed `getCurrentPositionAsync` not resolving on Android when the lowest accuracy is used. ([#9251](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9251) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
- Fixed `LocationGeocodedAddress` type to reflect the possibility of receiving `null` values. ([#9444](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9444) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))

## 8.3.0 ‚Äî 2020-07-16

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Added some safety checks to prevent `NullPointerExceptions` in background location on Android. ([#8864](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8864) by [@mczernek](https://github.com/mczernek))
- Add `isoCountryCode` to `Address` type and reverse lookup. ([#8913](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8913) by [@bycedric](https://github.com/bycedric))
- Fix geocoding requests not resolving/rejecting on iOS when the app is in the background or inactive state. It makes it possible to use geocoding in such app states, however it's still discouraged. ([#9178](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9178) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
