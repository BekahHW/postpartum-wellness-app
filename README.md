# Postpartum Wellness App

This app is to help women monitor their mental and physical wellness after having a baby. With a new baby, life is full of new and exciting things as well as challenges. For some women, being aware of their mental and physical health helps them to take care of themselves. Other women face postpartum depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD. This app is meant to help everyone find the right path after having a baby.

The profile keeps track of important information in order to help each user determine where they need help or to monitor daily habits. The app will help you to celebrate your wins and to find community and help when you need it.
