# Postpartum Wellness App

This app is to help women monitor their mental and physical wellness after having a baby. With a new baby, life is full of new and exciting things as well as challenges. For some women, being aware of their mental and physical health helps them to take care of themselves. Other women face postpartum depression, anxiety, PTSD, other postpartum mood disorders. And it happens more frequently than we realize or talk about. This app is meant to help postpartum moms find a healthy path post birth, to provide a resource for monitoring their mental health, and to provide support that can lead to early diagnoses of postpartum mental health disorders.

The profile keeps track of important information in order to help each user determine where they need help or to monitor daily habits. The app will also help you to celebrate your wins and find community or help when you need it.
