# What is the Postpartum Wellness App

This app is to help women monitor their mental and physical wellness after having a baby. With a new baby, life is full of new and exciting things as well as challenges. For some women, being aware of their mental and physical health helps them to take care of themselves. Other women face postpartum depression, anxiety, PTSD, other postpartum mood disorders. And it happens more frequently than we realize or talk about. This app is meant to help postpartum moms find a healthy path post birth, to provide a resource for monitoring their mental health, and to provide support that can lead to early diagnoses of postpartum mental health disorders.

The profile keeps track of important information in order to help each user determine where they need help or to monitor daily habits. The app will also help you to celebrate your wins and find community or help when you need it.

# Project Goals

This is a passion project, and I'm learning as I go. Ultimately, the project will collect enough data to provide support to women who are facing postpartum mental health issues. Currently, the project is in Phase 1, setting up basic UI elements, without the full styling and custom art we see in the future.

This will likely be a long running project, with multiple phases that will include:

- Working with AWS Amplify
- Creating a clear [workflow](https://www.figma.com/file/GV6j3SxSSPZEpql0xV2etL/Workflows?node-id=0%3A1)
- Creating a clear [design aesthetic](https://www.figma.com/file/WB41mEaTanI6PWldMfENxQ/Material-Design-Theme-Kit-Copy)
- Machine learning

If any of that sounds interesting, don't hesitate to take a look at one of our [issues](https://github.com/BekahHW/postpartum-wellness-app/issues) and dive in.
