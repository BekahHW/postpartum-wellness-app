# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! Your contribution will hopefully work towards improving the lives of postpartum women, and your time is greatly appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are two ways to contribute: working on an issue and submitting a pull request when complete (if you're new to submitting a pull request, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5tXiZ3U4Xk&feature=youtu.be) walks you through the steps of the first PR for this app) or submitting a bug report.

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the Postpartum Wellness App. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

# What type of contributions we're looking for.

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute,
from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests,
or writing code which can be incorporated into the application codebase itself. Please note, that if an issue has a label with Good First Issue, those are reserved for contributors new to development.

Once you've commented on an issue to say you'd like to work on it, wait for a response from the maintainer before you begin working.

# Asking to Pair

This is a beginner friendly repo. Contributors can request a pairing (zoom/google hangouts) to pair with a maintainer on tackling an issue/submitting a PR/etc. If you want to do it for a pre-existing issue, simple indicate so in a comment under that issue. If not, you may open a new Question issue and request a pairing.

## Awaiting Review

Once you've submitted your pull request, the only thing left is to wait from feedback from one of the project maintainers. Since this is volunteer work for all of course, we ask for patience if you don't see a response immediately. Sometimes it takes about a day for someone's schedule to clear up to have the sit to properly review incoming PRs. We'd rather not rush a response after someone has put time and effort into submitted. If it's been over **one week** and you haven't received any acknowledgement, you can post a comment on your PR reminding of it's status. If **two weeks** have passed with no feedback, you can email the project maintainer at rhawrot@gmail.com.

If the PR looks good, a maintainer will typically give feedback and merge the request immediately, otherwise they'll let you know what questions they have or what needs to change before your work can be accepted. Once it is, you'll see your changes on the main branch and VOILA, open source contribution complete!

## Tips and Gotchas

This section is just little notes and bits of info that can smooth over some of the bumps and hiccups that can come along with contribution.

- While this isn't absolutely required, we highly recommend **associating your Pull Requests with the Issue that they're intended to address**. This makes review much easier and avoids confusion when looking back at past commits. Github allows you to link a PR to an issue both during and after the PR's creation (the option should located in rightmost panel of the github PR interface).
- **Please do not hesitate to ask for help** in any part of this process if you feel confused. As soon as they can, project maintainers can try and get you through the parts which are confusing you. Just be aware that no one here is a github expert :), we're just folks happy and willing to help others get some experience.
- Be extra careful when working with git in the command line. Incorrectly typed names or commands can have strange results, and navigating git issues can be very perplexing. Fortunately, there's a plethora of resources on fixing said issues, and rest assured that any error you make has already been done, and solved, by someone.

That's all for now. If you feel like anything is missing from this document that you wish were included, let us know. Or hey, open up a fresh issue and take a shot at helping us make it better!

# Reporting a bug

If you find a **critical security vulnerability**, do NOT open an issue. Email rhawrot@gmail.com instead.

For any other bug, we have a bug report template already created for your use. Just select it when opening up an issue on github and follow the headers to formulating your issue.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the Postpartum Wellness App? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Local development
The Postpartum Wellness App and all packages can be developed locally.
